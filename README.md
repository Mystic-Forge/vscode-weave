# Weave

This extension provides syntax highlighting for `.wv` files.

Weave is language made to provide an accessible yet flexible interface to contributors and modders of MysticForge projects. Weave is currently under development and so the language (and therefor this extension) is subject to change.

## Features

As it stands the extension provides syntax highlighting for the language. Possible future features include:
* Auto completion
* Code snippets
* Folding
* Code linting
